### What the heck is this?
This repo houses the code for the Gatsby application [`Gradiatior`](https://gradiator.netlify.app/). Gradiator is a util PWA which you can use to create gradients. The idea of it being the enablement more developers to use gradients painlessly. While the app targets web developers / web designers, I wish to make this small project reach a stage where any gradient enthusiast regardless of their background can use this and get something out of it.

### Intent
I started this project initially to get a better grip on [`Gatsby`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) the framework but with the conviction to provide something useful to the dev community, I decided to make this project more than just a beginner project for my own learning and have gone ahead to publish this on [`Netlify`](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Contributions

Being a beginner in Gatsby, I was too shy to share my code publicly but let go of it for 2 reasons:
* One being that I would like for the application itself to receive any form of criticism from its users if any.
* Second being that I am going to welcome fellow developers who are willing to look at my code and point out bad practices or spaghetti code.

Having said that, if you are willing to contribute to this project, feel free to create a PR and I'd love to collaborate. If you want to request for stuff on the app, you can obviously create issues on this repo.

Here's how you can get the local app running:

```
git clone https://github.com/narayanasuri/gradiator.git
```

Then go inside the project folder and gatsby develop (make sure you have node version 16 or above):
```
cd gradiator
gatsby develop
```
